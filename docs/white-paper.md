# Whitepaper Token Scol (Scolcoin) 2.0 Our Smart Contracts

## Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

Our smart Contracts are BEP-20. For Techincal Details on BEP-20 Standard: https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bep-20

Scolcoin (SCOL) tokens were written in Solidity. Be sure to check out their tutorial before jumping into code: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.9/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html

Implementations of standards ERC20

Source code: https://github.com/scolcoin/Token-Scolcoin-SCOL/blob/main/scolcoin.sol

## OpenZeppelin - The secure implementation

Our Smart Contracts are based on secure and trusted [OpenZeppelin ERC-20 Smart Contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20)

OpenZeppelin code is at the heart of our tokens and we follow their security practices and implementation very carefully.

# Scolcoin (SCOL) Token

This token is a standard ERC-20 implementation and was deployed on Binance Smart Chain mainnet with fixed Max Supply of 80,000,000 SCOL. 1 SCOL tokens were ultimately. To bootstrap the Scolcoin Native Blockchain ecosystem.

Mainnet Deployed Scolcoin (SCOL) Token can be found here: https://bscscan.com/token/0x703477125bbee6430b2c4968c1ef66701a01359f

Compilation Parameters: Solidity 0.8.10+commit.fc410830. Optimization 200

## Libraries & Interfaces

```Solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.2;
```
We've deployed Scolcoin token to mainnet with solidity ^0.8.2.

```Solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
```
Right away we get into the heavy usage of OpenZeppelin secure libraries. This is the base ERC-20 implementation that SCOL is based on.

```Solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Snapshot.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/Pausable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-ERC20Permit.sol";
```
We've already included scolcoin.sol, why include the interface? SCOL smart contract accepts a _token as one of the constructore parameters. We'll discuss this in the **constructor** section below.

## ERC20Burnable
Our Token can perform the function of Burning Token, make Repurchases to be able to Burn Tokens

** _burn(account, amount); **

Code:

```Solidity
/**
 * @dev Extension of {ERC20} that allows token holders to destroy both their own
 * tokens and those that they have an allowance for, in a way that can be
 * recognized off-chain (via event analysis).
 */
abstract contract ERC20Burnable is Context, ERC20 {
    /**
     * @dev Destroys `amount` tokens from the caller.
     *
     * See {ERC20-_burn}.
     */
    function burn(uint256 amount) public virtual {
        _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Destroys `amount` tokens from `account`, deducting from the caller's
     * allowance.
     *
     * See {ERC20-_burn} and {ERC20-allowance}.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - the caller must have allowance for ``accounts``'s tokens of at least
     * `amount`.
     */
    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual {
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(account, _msgSender());
        require(currentAllowance >= amount, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds allowance");
        unchecked {
            _approve(account, _msgSender(), currentAllowance - amount);
        }
        _burn(account, amount);
    }
}

```

## ERC20Snapshot
With the Snapshop function it allows us to get support from the token at any time to have it for consultations for defined seasons for a consecutive one, or to take balances from all the holders

** _snapshot(); **

Code:

```Solidity
abstract contract ERC20Snapshot is ERC20 {
    // Inspired by Jordi Baylina's MiniMeToken to record historical balances:
    // https://github.com/Giveth/minimd/blob/ea04d950eea153a04c51fa510b068b9dded390cb/contracts/MiniMeToken.sol

    using Arrays for uint256[];
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;

    // Snapshotted values have arrays of ids and the value corresponding to that id. These could be an array of a
    // Snapshot struct, but that would impede usage of functions that work on an array.
    struct Snapshots {
        uint256[] ids;
        uint256[] values;
    }

    mapping(address => Snapshots) private _accountBalanceSnapshots;
    Snapshots private _totalSupplySnapshots;

    // Snapshot ids increase monotonically, with the first value being 1. An id of 0 is invalid.
    Counters.Counter private _currentSnapshotId;

    /**
     * @dev Emitted by {_snapshot} when a snapshot identified by `id` is created.
     */
    event Snapshot(uint256 id);

    /**
     * @dev Creates a new snapshot and returns its snapshot id.
     *
     * Emits a {Snapshot} event that contains the same id.
     *
     * {_snapshot} is `internal` and you have to decide how to expose it externally. Its usage may be restricted to a
     * set of accounts, for example using {AccessControl}, or it may be open to the public.
     *
     * [WARNING]
     * ====
     * While an open way of calling {_snapshot} is required for certain trust minimization mechanisms such as forking,
     * you must consider that it can potentially be used by attackers in two ways.
     *
     * First, it can be used to increase the cost of retrieval of values from snapshots, although it will grow
     * logarithmically thus rendering this attack ineffective in the long term. Second, it can be used to target
     * specific accounts and increase the cost of ERC20 transfers for them, in the ways specified in the Gas Costs
     * section above.
     *
     * We haven't measured the actual numbers; if this is something you're interested in please reach out to us.
     * ====

        require(snapshotId <= _getCurrentSnapshotId(), "ERC20Snapshot: nonexistent id");

        // When a valid snapshot is queried, there are three possibilities:
        //  a) The queried value was not modified after the snapshot was taken. Therefore, a snapshot entry was never
        //  created for this id, and all stored snapshot ids are smaller than the requested one. The value that corresponds
        //  to this id is the current one.

        //  requested id, and its value is the one to return.
        //  c) More snapshots were created after the requested one, and the queried value was later modified. There will be
        //  no entry for the requested id: the value that corresponds to it is that of the smallest snapshot id that is
        //  larger than the requested one.
        //

        // it is not found, unless said value doesn't exist (e.g. when all values are smaller). Arrays.findUpperBound does
        // exactly this.

## AccessControl
Access control—that is, "who is allowed to do this thing"—is incredibly important in the world of smart contracts. The access control of your contract may govern who can mint tokens, freeze transfers, and many other things. It is therefore critical to understand how you implement it, lest someone else steals your whole system.

Code:

```Solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @dev String operations.
 */
library Strings {
    bytes16 private constant _HEX_SYMBOLS = "0123456789abcdef";

    /**
     * @dev Converts a `uint256` to its ASCII `string` decimal representation.
     */
    function toString(uint256 value) internal pure returns (string memory) {

            digits++;
            temp /= 10;
        }
        bytes memory buffer = new bytes(digits);

    }

    function toHexString(uint256 value) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        if (value == 0) {

        }
        uint256 temp = value;
        uint256 length = 0;

## Pausable
the ability to for all system operations with the system administrator, this allows to prevent losses.

Code:

```Solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @dev Provides information about the current execution context, including the
 * sender of the transaction and its data. While these are generally available
 * via msg.sender and msg.data, they should not be accessed in such a direct
 * manner, since when dealing with meta-transactions the account sending and
 * paying for execution may not be the actual sender (as far as an application
 * is concerned).
 *
 * This contract is only required for intermediate, library-like contracts.
 */
abstract contract Context {
    function _msgSender() internal view virtual returns (address) {
        return msg.sender;
    }

    function _msgData() internal view virtual returns (bytes calldata) {
        return msg.data;
