# Whitepaper Token Scol (Scolcoin) 2.0 Our Smart Contracts

## Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

Our smart Contracts are BEP-20. For Techincal Details on BEP-20 Standard: https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bep-20

Scolcoin (SCOL) tokens were written in Solidity. Be sure to check out their tutorial before jumping into code: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.9/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html

## OpenZeppelin - The secure implementation

Our Smart Contracts are based on secure and trusted [OpenZeppelin ERC-20 Smart Contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20)

OpenZeppelin code is at the heart of our tokens and we follow their security practices and implementation very carefully.
